# PoMoHomoBro
A discord bot that helps you study using
the "Pomodoro" method\
-Dont fear PoMoHomoBro is here-\
#How to use\
**time measurement is in minutes**\
**!start focus time | rest time | long rest time | number of sessions**\
**eg..**\
**!start 30 5 60 4**\
*where* 
- 30 is focus minutes/learning time\
- 5 is rest/break minutes\
- 60 is the long rest/break minutes\
- 4 is the number of rounds/session\

**Why no Pause option?**\
although PoMohomoBro is nice he can be strict specially on its duty\
**PoMoHomobro says-** 
*"Pomodoro is made for us to have a focused learning time, pausing and doing something or even an emergency will break the
very concept of the POMODORO method"*
